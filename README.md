# SVG-Logo-Builder-back-end-

## Description

The JavaScript code for the SVG Logo Builder is complete according to the following: 

* The application uses enquirer and Jest packages for user input and testing.
* Application asks users for style specifications to create the svg file they want.
* It is possible to pick one out of three shapes, which is used to generate an object of that class and render the logo.
* Users can test the application by running "npm run test" after installing the Jest package.

## Installation

Users must install dependencies prior to first use by inputting the command npm i into the console.

## Testing

To test this application, use the test files in the lib folder. You can run tests by typing "npm run test" into the terminal. Tests require the Jest package.

## Usage

Users should input three parameters and make one selection to generate their logos. They need a three letters initials string, a font color, a shape color, and they should pick a shape for their logo.

## Credits

Thanks to the SVG documentation on how to create an svg file from scratch. I had to revisit class content to finish the testing part and it was useful for this project.
